== Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs

*Link:* https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/

*Difficulty:* Medium

=== Description

You are given the ``root`` of a binary tree and an integer ``distance``.
A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length
of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to ``distance``.

Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

1. Example

image::image.jpg[]

- Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
- Output: 1
- Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the shortest path between them is 3.
This is the only good pair.
