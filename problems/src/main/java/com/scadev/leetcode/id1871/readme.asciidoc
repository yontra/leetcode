== Jump Game VII

*Link:* https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vii/

*Difficulty:* Medium

=== Description
You are given a ``0-indexed`` binary string ``s`` and two integers ``minJump`` and ``maxJump``.
In the beginning, you are standing at index ``0``, which is equal to '0'.
You can move from index ``i`` to index ``j`` if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- ``i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1)``, and
- ``s[j] == '0'``.

Return ``true`` if you can reach index ``s.length - 1`` in ``s``, or ``false`` otherwise.

Example 1:

- Input: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
- Output: true
- Explanation:
In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3.
In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.

Example 2:

- Input: s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
- Output: false
