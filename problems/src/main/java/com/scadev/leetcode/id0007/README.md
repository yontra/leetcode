Name: Reverse Integer
Difficulty: Medium
Description:
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. 
If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
